# 🔧 Fix Supabase "Access Denied" Error

The "access denied" error means your magic link is working, but the redirect URLs aren't configured properly in your Supabase project.

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Go to Your Supabase Dashboard
1. Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fxbpsuisqzffyggihvin
2. Sign in if needed

### Step 2: Navigate to Authentication Settings
1. In the left sidebar, click **Authentication**
2. Click **URL Configuration**

### Step 3: Add Redirect URLs
In the **Redirect URLs** section, add these URLs (one per line):

```
http://localhost:8080
http://localhost:8080/
http://localhost:8080/auth/callback
http://localhost:8080/#/auth/callback
```

### Step 4: Save Changes
1. Click **Save** at the bottom of the page
2. Wait for the changes to apply

### Step 5: Test Again
1. Go back to your Flutter app: http://localhost:8080
2. Enter your email again
3. Check your email for the new magic link
4. Click the magic link - it should now work!

## 🔍 Alternative: Check Site URL

Also make sure your **Site URL** is set to:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

## 🚨 If Still Not Working

If you still get errors, try these additional URLs:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8080
http://127.0.0.1:8080/
http://127.0.0.1:8080/auth/callback
```

## 📱 What Should Happen

After clicking the magic link, you should:
1. Be redirected back to your Flutter app
2. See the dashboard with the green "Get JWT Token for Testing" button
3. Be able to click the button to get your JWT token

## 🎉 Success!

Once you're authenticated, you can:
1. Click the green "Get JWT Token for Testing" button
2. Copy the JWT token from the console
3. Test the upload API with curl

Let me know when you've updated the Supabase settings and we can test the authentication again!
