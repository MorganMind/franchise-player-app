# DM Routing Test Guide

## Test Steps

### 1. Test DM Button from Sidebar
1. Click the DM button (chat bubble icon) in the server sidebar
2. **Expected Result**: Should navigate to `/dm` and show the DM inbox sidebar
3. **URL**: Should change to `http://localhost:8080/dm`

### 2. Test Direct URL Access
1. Manually navigate to `http://localhost:8080/dm`
2. **Expected Result**: Should show the DM inbox sidebar
3. **State**: `_showDmInbox` should be `true`

### 3. Test DM Thread Navigation
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/dm/some-thread-id`
2. **Expected Result**: Should show the DM inbox with the specific thread
3. **State**: `_activeDmThreadId` should be set to the thread ID

### 4. Test Navigation from Home Dashboard
1. Go to the home dashboard
2. Click on DM-related navigation
3. **Expected Result**: Should work as before (this was already working)

## What Was Fixed

1. **Added `/dm` route** - General DM inbox route without a specific thread
2. **Created `_openDmInbox()` method** - Properly handles DM inbox navigation
3. **Updated `_goHome()` method** - Now calls `_openDmInbox()` instead of navigating to `/`
4. **Fixed `_openDm()` method** - Now sets `_showDmInbox = true` to show the sidebar
5. **Updated `initState()`** - Handles the general `/dm` route properly

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ DM button in sidebar navigates to `/dm`
- ✅ DM inbox sidebar appears when on `/dm` route
- ✅ Direct URL access to `/dm` works
- ✅ Specific DM threads still work (`/dm/thread-id`)
- ✅ Home dashboard DM navigation still works
