## 🚨 Common Magic Link Issues

- **Solution**: Click the link immediately after receiving it

- **Cause**: Redirect URLs not configured properly
- **Solution**: Add correct redirect URLs in Supabase

- ✅ Email template is configured
- ✅ Authentication system is functional

**The issue is likely:**

2. **Use the same browser window** where you sent the request
3. **Check browser console** (F12) for any errors
4. **Update redirect URLs** in Supabase if needed
